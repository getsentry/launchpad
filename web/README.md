# Launchpad Size Analysis Viewer

A simple React web application for visualizing treemap data generated by the Launchpad size analysis tool.

## Features

- **Interactive Treemap Visualization**: Uses ECharts to display hierarchical size data
- **Dual Size Modes**: Switch between install size and download size views
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload JSON files
- **Category Breakdown**: Detailed breakdown of sizes by category
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app in the browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Click on the upload area or drag a JSON file generated by the Launchpad size analysis tool
2. **Switch Views**: Use the "Size Mode" dropdown to switch between install and download sizes
3. **Explore**: Click on different sections of the treemap to drill down into the data
4. **Category Breakdown**: Scroll down to see detailed size breakdowns by category

## Supported File Format

The app expects JSON files with the following structure (matching the Python `TreemapResults` model):

```json
{
  "root": {
    "name": "Root",
    "install_size": 1000000,
    "download_size": 800000,
    "is_directory": true,
    "children": [...],
    "details": {}
  },
  "total_install_size": 1000000,
  "total_download_size": 800000,
  "file_count": 100,
  "category_breakdown": {...},
  "platform": "ios"
}
```

## Sample Data

For testing, you can use the `sample-data.json` file included in the public directory.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript

- **Files**: Blue
- **Executables**: Red
- **Resources**: Green
- **Assets**: Orange
- **Frameworks**: Dark Orange (iOS)
- **DEX Files**: Yellow (Android)
- **Native Libraries**: Purple
- And more...
